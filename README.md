## 👋 About Me

I got my PhD in Mathematical Sciences (Optimisation focused) from Federation University Australia in 2024. Before that I got my BEng in Industrial Engineering from Vietnam National University in 2020. My work generally involves developing efficient splitting methods to solve structured optimisation problems.

## 🔬 Projects

### 🌟 Centre for New Energy Transition Research (CfNETR), Federation University Australia

* Centre for New Energy Technologies (C4NET)’s “Enhanced System Planning Project” funded by Victorian
government: Work packages [3.11](https://c4net.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WP-3.11-Final-report-Federation-University.pdf) and [3.12](https://c4net.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WP-3.12-Final-Report-Federation-Uni.pdf). Developed an open-source [Python tool](https://github.com/nhattan214/ASC) for ancillary service
calculation.

* “Energy Demand Mapping – Wimmera, Mallee, and Northwest of Victoria” project and “Intelligent Outlier
Processing for Net Demand Time Series” project funded by Department of Energy, Environment and
Climate Action (DEECA).

* ARC Linkage project on “Transforming Microgrid to Virtual Power Plant ICT Frameworks, Tools, Control”.
Develop a controlling framework for inverter-based resources in microgrid to maintain frequency stability
in the microgrids.
