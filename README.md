## 👋 About Me

I got my PhD in Mathematical Sciences (Optimisation focused) from Federation University in 2024. Before that I got my BEng in Industrial Engineering from Vietnam National University in 2020. My work generally involves developing efficient splitting methods to solve structured optimisation problems.
